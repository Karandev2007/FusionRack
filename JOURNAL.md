# Zentra Journal

## TOTAL TIME SPEND: 34h

Day 1 (27/7/25): (6h)

- made a rough list of components, it was easy as its clear in my mind what i have to make.
- trying some designs with sora and fusion with whats in my mind rn. im planning to have capacity of 2x Raspberry Pi 2W, 2x Raspberry Pi 3,4,5, 1x mini pc, most prob Lenovo Thinkcentre, with proper cooling and a screen to moniter all or specific thats depends on me. so a cheap 3.5 inch display with raspberry pi 2W, fans, switches and more.

skeleton structure image:

- i researched for like more than 3–4 hours on structure, what can be used to make it better, sourced some more parts, tried over 12 designs on frame + case. resolved a problem to divide parts in a manner that they can be printed, because in India we have Bambu Lab A1 Mini and Creality ENDER 3 V3 KE from Printing-Legion, so max plates we can make are 8.66 × 7.08 inches. Mini-PC size alone is 7.20 x 7.05 in, so we are hitting depth only, else is okay. I will try arrangements on a dummy plate of the mini-PC with accurate sizes to get more confirmed about things.


Day 2 (28/7/25): (12h so far)
- discussed some drawbacks and issues with my current designs and materials with shub, and sourced more parts. for the pillars on the edge, i will now use 8mm lead screw stainless steel rods. with them, i will use T8 circular single-start nuts to attach to the plates. im lucky that the filaments in my country are ABS, still i will keep the thickness greater, including cross strips to distribute the weight on the bottom and second middle plate.

i will use honey comb plates with magnets for front and back side of platforms gaps, and on right and left sides a cooling fan with honey comb walls.

- i got to know that Creality from Printing-Legion is not available. so im forced to use Bambu Lab A1 Mini which means 180mm x 180mm / 7*7 inches, means now we cant place our mini-pc also space for rpi's will also be decreased, but i came up with a new plan reference image is below:

<img width="244" height="623" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08d96bee-7353-41c6-b29a-be40506a6c37" />

- i have restructured whole lab, so it will be increased in height from 12 inches to 16 or 19 depending upon lead screw rods. but we got plus points, as now we will vertically install all pi's and mainly our mini-pc's so we can install like 4 mini pc instead of 1, just need to find a way to fit any minipc on its place maybe using moving mount or something, major companies like HP, lenovo, dell all have almost same size just 2-4 inches difference which can affect for sure.

- here is base i made with 10mm thickness with bottom support stands of 10mm and boundries on all side except front of 5mm, i will add more bottom stands for support as base plate will handle 3-4 mini-pc on it so i dont want that it get broken or bended.

Day 3 (29/7/25): (10h)

- made 3 holes for wiring etc with 30mm diameter and gap btw them of 31mm.
- remove bottom stands from body as it will make printing complex so i made 10mm bottom stands separate.
- sourced components for controller PCB, also [finalized fans](https://makerbazar.in/products/generic-axial-dc-cooling-fan-blowers?variant=46399947931888#product-reviews)

- Made plate 2 and 3 and placed all pis with accurate sizes.

- one more plate completed with objects, usb hub, externals, etc.

- Decreased gaps btw plates for better appearance now it looks like this:

- added 8mm lead screw rods on all 4 corners for support

- added handles of top to pick and and move, as it will not alway have load so adding handles will be useful.

- handles done :D

## some polished structure images :D

- removed handles from top plate cuz it needs alot of support while printing so we have now separate handles here:

# Day 4-5 (31/7/25) - (1/8/25): (6h)

- got to know the guy in printing legion left that had required printer for my prints, i checked local 3d printing services which are demanding over 4000inr/45.76$ for a single print that max weights 300g, so i decieded to change whole design to make it printable with the printing legion available printer. here are designs:

<img width="260" height="414" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/366c5ced-8924-46a1-93f7-29c5d3150a8f" />
- added name on top of project:

- made honey comb grids. this took me straight 30 mins, i did alot of hit and try.

- cut the whole setup into 2 so it can be printed, cuz it the reason im remaking it at last moment to fit in printer size.

- added magnets placeholders for front and back plates.
